**Why are strings in c# immutable?**

In C#, arrays have a fixed size, which means that once an array is created of some size, it cannot be dynamically increased or decreased in size. 
The CLR (Common Language Runtime) in C#, stores the strings as an array of characters. So whenever we delete or add a character or characters to
a string, the original arrays of characters are fixed, and hence a new array of characters is created to accommodate the change. 
This is known as the immutability of strings in C#.

**What is the System.String class in C# and why is it important in string manipulation operations?**

The System.String class in C# represents a sequence of characters and is used to perform various string manipulation operations. 
It is important in C# as it provides a wide range of methods for working with strings, such as concatenation, substring extraction, searching,
and formatting.

**Explain the difference between value types and reference types in C# with respect to string manipulation.**

In C#, value types are stored directly in the memory stack, while reference types are stored in the memory heap and accessed through a reference.

System.String class is a reference type in C# and is stored in the memory heap. 
When performing string manipulation operations on a System.String object, a new object is created in the memory heap, as strings are immutable in C#. 
This can impact performance and memory usage in certain scenarios.

**How can you concatenate strings efficiently in C# to minimize memory allocations?**

In C#, concatenating strings using the + operator or the string.Concat() method can result in multiple memory allocations,
which can impact performance. To concatenate strings efficiently, you can use the System.Text.StringBuilder class, 
which provides a mutable buffer to efficiently concatenate strings. You can append strings to the StringBuilder object using the Append() method and
then retrieve the final concatenated string using the ToString() method.

**Can you explain the concept of string interpolation in C# and how it differs from traditional string concatenation?**

String interpolation is a feature in C# that allows you to embed expressions directly into string literals to create formatted strings. 
It is denoted by a leading $ character before the string, and expressions inside curly braces {} within the string are evaluated and replaced with their values at runtime.

For example:

string name = "John";
int age = 30;
double salary = 5000.50;
string message = $"My name is {name}, I'm {age} years old, and my salary is {salary:C2}.";
In this example, the expressions {name}, {age}, and {salary:C2} are evaluated at runtime and replaced with their values in the resulting string.
The :C2 is a format specifier that formats the salary value as a currency with two decimal places.

String interpolation offers several advantages over traditional string concatenation:

Readability: String interpolation makes it easier to understand and write formatted strings by embedding expressions directly into the string literal,
making the code more readable and concise

Type safety: String interpolation automatically converts expressions to the correct types, eliminating the need for explicit type casting or
conversion, and catching type-related errors at compile-time.

Performance: String interpolation is generally more efficient than traditional string concatenation, especially when dealing with complex expressions or
multiple concatenations, as it avoids creating unnecessary intermediate string objects.

**How can you manipulate strings using loops in C#? Write some sample scenarios.**

You can manipulate strings using loops in C# by iterating over each character in the string and performing the desired operations. 
Here are some examples of string manipulations using loops:

Reverse a string:

string input = "Hello";
string reversed = "";
for (int i = input.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
    reversed += input[i];
}


Remove white spaces from a string:

string input = "  Hello  ";
string trimmed = "";
for (int i = 0; i < input.Length; i++)
{
    if (!char.IsWhiteSpace(input[i]))
    {
        trimmed += input[i];
    }
}


Count the occurrences of a specific character in a string:

string input = "Hello world";
char targetChar = 'l';
int count = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < input.Length; i++)
{
    if (input[i] == targetChar)
    {
        count++;
    }
}


It's important to note that string manipulation using loops can be inefficient, as strings in C# are immutable, 
meaning that each operation that modifies a string creates a new string object. In performance-critical scenarios, 
it's recommended to use the StringBuilder class for efficient string manipulations.
